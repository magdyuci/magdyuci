- 👋 Hi, I’m @magdyuci
- 👀 I’m interested in the progress that test automation has made in software development and the many benefits it offers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning spring boot to understand more about the development process in this technology and why not keep learning the java language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on important projects that works with tecnologies like maven, testNG, java, rest assured, selenium, kafka, rabbitMQ (if possible fintech projects)
